# required values
battery_capacity: 10.65 # in kWh - nominal stored energy of battery at 100% SOC (eg 7.1 = 2 * Pylontech US3000C with Nominal Capacity of 3.55 kWh each)
battery_max_current: 111 # in amps (eg 74 = 2 * Pylontech US3000C with Recommend Charge Current of 37A each) 
# Also see  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1A80cSOrhA to find battery Dis/Charging Current Limits
inverter_max_current: 62.5 # in amps - see inverter datasheet specs for 'Max. charge / discharge current'  (eg 62.5A or 100A)
charge_period: # Octopus Flux Cheap period when energy can be imported from the grid at low rates
  start: "02:05"
  end: "04:55" 
  current: 50 # charge current in amps
  sync: 'end' # if 'start', charging is tied to start of period or if 'end' it is tied to the end (otherwise it starts randomly)
charge_period2: # secondary charge period - for topping up battery if necessary at medium rates to avoid importing at subsequent peak rates
  start: "14:30"
  end: "15:30" 
  current: 50 # charge current in amps
  sync: 'end' # if 'start', charging is tied to start of period or if 'end' it is tied to the end (otherwise it starts randomly)
discharge_period: # Octopus Flux Peak period when energy can be exported to the grid at high rates
  start: "16:05"
  end: "18:55"
  current: 50 # discharge current in amps
  sync: 'start' # if 'start', charging is tied to start of period or if 'end' it is tied to the end (otherwise it starts randomly)
