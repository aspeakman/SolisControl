    morning_requirement: 12.0 # ideal target kWh level for rest of the day (solar predicted + battery stored) at morning charge period
    # zero means morning charging will be actively turned off each day (use a negative number to disable any action in the morning)
    evening_requirement: 5.0 # ideal target kWh level for rest of the day (solar predicted + battery stored) at evening discharge period
    # zero means evening discharging will be actively turned off each day (use a negative number to disable any action in the evening)
